# Snake Game

A classic snake game built in Python using the Turtle module.

## Overview

This Snake Game consists of four main Python files:

- `SnakeGame.py`: The main file to run the game.
- `snake.py`: Contains the Snake class responsible for snake movement and behavior.
- `food.py`: Defines the Food class, which represents the food for the snake to eat.
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the scoring system and displays the score on the screen.

## How to Play

1. Run `SnakeGame.py`.
2. Use arrow keys to control the snake: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
3. Eat the food to grow the snake and earn points.
4. If the snake runs into the wall or itself, the game ends.

## Features

- Snake grows longer and faster as it eats food.
- Score is displayed on the screen.
- High score is stored in `data.txt`.
- Snake resets and high score updates upon game over.
